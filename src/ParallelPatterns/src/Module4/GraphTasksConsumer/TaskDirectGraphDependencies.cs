    //  meaning that these methods are expected to be called sequentially, 
    //  first using AddOperation to add all of the operations to execute, and then calling Execute.
    //  As a result, notice that AddOperation accesses the dictionaries 
    //  without any locks or other mechanism for shared state synchronization.
    //  However, Execute does wrap part of its body in a lock. 
    //  This is because once it's queued up the first work item to run, that work item may access 
    //  and modify the dictionaries concurrently with the rest of the Execute body. 
    //  To prevent such races from happening, the rest of the body of Execute is protected. 
    //  When all relevant work has been queued, the Execute method blocks waiting for all of the work to complete.

    // (3) Bonus implemet these options
    // a. For operations with no dependencies, 
    //    you may want those to be able to start running as soon as they're added to the TaskDirectGraphDependencies, 
    //    rather than having to wait until Execute is called.
    // b. You may want operations to be able to return data that is passed along to dependencies, hence building up large dataflow networks.
