(1) FIRST THAT WE HAVE GRANTED TO GOD and by this present charter have confirmed for us and our heirs in perpetuity that the English Church shall be free and shall have its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired That we wish this so to be observed appears from the fact that of our own free will before the outbreak of the present dispute between us and our barons we granted and confirmed by charter the freedom of the Churchs elections — a right reckoned to be of the greatest necessity and importance to it — and caused this to be confirmed by Pope Innocent III This freedom we shall observe ourselves and desire to be observed in good faith by our heirs in perpetuity

TO ALL FREE MEN OF OUR KINGDOM we have also granted for us and our heirs for ever all the liberties written out below to have and to keep for them and their heirs of us and our heirs:

(2) If any earl baron or other person that holds lands directly of the Crown for military service shall die and at his death his heir shall be of full age and owe a relief the heir shall have his inheritance on payment of the ancient scale of relief That is to say the heir or heirs of an earl shall pay £100 for the entire earls barony the heir or heirs of a knight l00s at most for the entire knights fee and any man that owes less shall pay less in accordance with the ancient usage of fees

(3) But if the heir of such a person is under age and a ward when he comes of age he shall have his inheritance without relief or fine

(4) The guardian of the land of an heir who is under age shall take from it only reasonable revenues customary dues and feudal services He shall do this without destruction or damage to men or property If we have given the guardianship of the land to a sheriff or to any person answerable to us for the revenues and he commits destruction or damage we will exact compensation from him and the land shall be entrusted to two worthy and prudent men of the same fee who shall be answerable to us for the revenues or to the person to whom we have assigned them If we have given or sold to anyone the guardianship of such land and he causes destruction or damage he shall lose the guardianship of it and it shall be handed over to two worthy and prudent men of the same fee who shall be similarly answerable to us

(5) For so long as a guardian has guardianship of such land he shall maintain the houses parks fish preserves ponds mills and everything else pertaining to it from the revenues of the land itself When the heir comes of age he shall restore the whole land to him stocked with plough teams and such implements of husbandry as the season demands and the revenues from the land can reasonably bear

 (10) If anyone who has borrowed a sum of money from Jews dies before the debt has been repaid his heir shall pay no interest on the debt for so long as he remains under age irrespective of whom he holds his lands If such a debt falls into the hands of the Crown it will take nothing except the principal sum specified in the bond

 (11) If a man dies owing money to Jews his wife may have her dower and pay nothing towards the debt from it If he leaves children that are under age their needs may also be provided for on a scale appropriate to the size of his holding of lands The debt is to be paid out of the residue reserving the service due to his feudal lords Debts owed to persons other than Jews are to be dealt with similarly

 (12) No scutage or aid may be levied in our kingdom without its general consent unless it is for the ransom of our person to make our eldest son a knight and (once) to marry our eldest daughter For these purposes only a reasonable aid may be levied Aids from the city of London are to be treated similarly
